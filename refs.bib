  abstract = {Blind signatures are a fundamental cryptographic primitive with numerous practical applications. While there exist many practical blind signatures from number-theoretic assumptions, the situation is far less satisfactory from post-quantum assumptions. In this work, we provide the first overall practical, lattice-based blind signature, supporting an unbounded number of signature queries and additionally enjoying optimal round complexity. We provide a detailed estimate of parameters achieved -- we obtain a signature of size slightly above 45KB, for a core-SVP hardness of 109 bits. The run-times of the signer, user and verifier are also very small. Our scheme relies on the Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan signature [STOC'08] and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for linear relations with small unknowns, which are significantly more efficient than their general purpose counterparts. Its security stems from a new and arguably natural assumption which we introduce, called the one-more-ISIS assumption. This assumption can be seen as a lattice analogue of the one-more-RSA assumption by Bellare et al [JoC'03]. To gain confidence in our assumption, we provide a detailed analysis of diverse attack strategies.},

A particularly interesting scheme in this context is the GPV signature scheme [GPV08] combined with the trapdoor construction from Micciancio and Peikert [MP12] as it admits strong security proofs and is believed to be very efficient in practice. This paper confirms this belief and shows how to improve the GPV scheme in terms of space and running time and presents an implementation of the optimized scheme. A ring variant of this scheme is also introduced which leads to a more efficient construction. Experimental results show that GPV with the new trapdoor construction is competitive to the signature schemes that are currently used in practice.},

Our group signature is based on a simple generic construction that can be instantiated by cryptographically hard group actions such as the CSIDH group action or an MLWE-based group action. The signature is of size \$O({\textbackslash}log N)\$, where \$N\$ is the number of users in the group. Our idea builds on the recent efficient OR-proof by Beullens, Katsumata, and Pintore (Asiacrypt'20), where we efficiently add a proof of valid ciphertext to their OR-proof and further show that the resulting non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system is online extractable. Our group signatures satisfy more ideal security properties compared to previously known constructions, while simultaneously having an attractive signature size. The signature size of our isogeny-based construction is an order of magnitude smaller than all previously known post-quantum group signatures (e.g., 6.6 KB for 64 members). In comparison, our lattice-based construction has a larger signature size (e.g., either 126 KB or 89 KB for 64 members depending on the satisfied security property). However, since the \$O({\textbackslash}cdot)\$-notation hides a very small constant factor, it remains small even for very large group sizes, say \$2\^\{20\}\$.Updated (Oct.28, 2021): Updated the references.},

Key homomorphic PRFs are natural objects to study and have a number of interesting applications: they can simplify the process of rotating encryption keys for encrypted data stored in the cloud, they give one round distributed PRFs, and they can be the basis of a symmetric-key proxy re-encryption scheme. Until now all known constructions for key homomorphic PRFs were only proven secure in the random oracle model. We construct the first provably secure key homomorphic PRFs in the standard model. Our main construction is based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem. We also give a construction based on the decision linear assumption in groups with an {$\mathscr{l}$}-linear map. We leave as an open problem the question of constructing standard model key homomorphic PRFs from more general assumptions.},

  abstract = {An oblivious PRF, or OPRF, is a protocol between a client and a server, where the server has a keyfor a secure pseudorandom function, and the client has an inputfor the function. At the end of the protocol the client learns, and nothing else, and the server learns nothing. An OPRF is verifiable if the client is convinced that the server has evaluated the PRF correctly with respect to a prior commitment to. OPRFs and verifiable OPRFs have numerous applications, such as private-set-intersection protocols, password-based key-exchange protocols, and defense against denial-of-service attacks. Existing OPRF constructions use RSA-, Diffie-Hellman-, and lattice-type assumptions. The first two are not post-quantum secure. In this paper we construct OPRFs and verifiable OPRFs from isogenies. Our main construction uses isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves overand tries to adapt the Diffie-Hellman OPRF to that setting. However, a recent attack on supersingular-isogeny systems due to Galbraith et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016] makes this approach difficult to secure. To overcome this attack, and to validate the server's response, we develop two new zero-knowledge protocols that convince each party that its peer has sent valid messages. With these protocols in place, we obtain an OPRF in the SIDH setting and prove its security in the UC framework. Our second construction is an adaptation of the Naor-Reingold PRF to commutative group actions. Combining it with recent constructions of oblivious transfer from isogenies, we obtain an OPRF in the CSIDH setting.},

The group manager can also reveal the identity of a signer if and when needed to enforce accountability and deter abuse. For group signatures to be applicable in practice, they need to support fully dynamic groups, i.e., users may join and leave at any time. Existing security definitions for fully dynamic group signatures are informal, have shortcomings, and are mutually incompatible. We fill the gap by providing a formal rigorous security model for fully dynamic group signatures. Our model is general and is not tailored towards a specific design paradigm and can therefore, as we show, be used to argue about the security of different existing constructions following different design paradigms. Our definitions are stringent and when possible incorporate protection against maliciously chosen keys. We consider both the case where the group management and tracing signatures are administered by the same authority, i.e.{\textasciitilde}a single group manager, and also the case where those roles are administered by two separate authorities, i.e. a group manager and an opening authority. We also show that a specialization of our model captures existing models for static and partially dynamic schemes. In the process, we identify a subtle gap in the security achieved by group signatures using revocation lists. We show that in such schemes new members achieve a slightly weaker notion of traceability. The flexibility of our security model allows to capture such relaxation of traceability.Minor edits},

The scheme is also compact in practice, with the proofs being as small as a few dozen kilobytes for arbitrarily large (say up to \$\$2\^\{128\}\$\$2128) numbers of users with each user having several attributes. The security of our scheme is based on a new family of lattice assumptions which roughly states that given short pre-images of random elements in some set S, it is hard to create a pre-image for a fresh element in such a set. We show that if the set admits efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of a commitment to a set element and its pre-image, then this yields practically-efficient privacy-preserving primitives such as blind signatures, anonymous credentials, and group signatures. We propose a candidate instantiation of a function from this family which allows for such proofs and thus yields practical lattice-based primitives.},

We apply our approach to the example use case of partially dynamic group signatures and obtain a lattice-based group signature that protects users against corrupted issuers, and that produces signatures smaller than the state of the art, with signature sizes of less than 300 KB for the comparably secure version of the scheme.

In this work, we identify flaws in security proofs of a number of qSDH-based DAA schemes and point out that none of the proposed schemes can be proven secure in the recent model by Camenisch et al.~(PKC 2016). We therefore present a new, provably secure DAA scheme that is based on the qSDH assumption. The new scheme is as efficient as the most efficient existing DAA scheme, with support for DAA extensions to signature-based revocation and attributes. We rigorously prove the scheme secure in the model of Camenisch et al., which we modify to support the extensions. As a side-result of independent interest, we prove that the BBS+ signature scheme is secure in the type-3 pairing setting, allowing for our scheme to be used with the most efficient pairing-friendly curves.},

  abstract = {A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.},

  abstract = {Anonymous authentication schemes such as group signatures and anonymous credentials are important privacy-protecting tools in electronic communications. The only currently known scheme based on assumptions that resist quantum attacks is the group signature scheme by Gordon et al. (ASIACRYPT 2010). We present a generalization of group signatures called *anonymous attribute tokens* where users are issued attribute-containing credentials that they can use to anonymously sign messages and generate tokens revealing only a subset of their attributes. We present two lattice-based constructions of this new primitive, one with and one without opening capabilities for the group manager. The latter construction directly yields as a special case the first lattice-based group signature scheme offering full anonymity (in the random-oracle model), as opposed to the practically less relevant notion of chosen-plaintext anonymity offered by the scheme of Gordon et al. We also extend our scheme to protect users from framing attacks by the group manager, where the latter creates tokens or signatures in the name of honest users. Our constructions involve new lattice-based tools for aggregating signatures and verifiable CCA2-secure encryption.},

These improvements speed-up the evaluation of most arithmetic functions in a packed leveled mode, with a noise overhead that remains additive. We finally present a new circuit bootstrapping that converts \$\${\textbackslash}mathsf \{LWE\}\$\$LWEinto low-noise \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{RingGSW\}\}\$\$RingGSWciphertexts in just 137~ms, which makes the leveled mode of TFHE composable, and which is fast enough to speed-up arithmetic functions, compared to the gate-by-gate bootstrapping given in [12].

Furthermore, the use of lattice-based primitives greatly simplifies the proofs of correctness, privacy and verifiability, as no zero-knowledge proof are needed to prove the validity of individual ballots or the correctness of the final election result. The security of our scheme is based on classical SIS/LWE assumptions, which are asymptotically as hard as worst-case lattice problems and relies on the random oracle heuristic. We also propose a new procedure to distribute the decryption task, where each trustee provides an independent proof of correct decryption in the form of a publicly verifiable ciphertext trapdoor. In particular, our protocol requires only two trustees, unlike classical proposals using threshold decryption via Shamir's secret sharing.},

Conjunction programs evaluate functions f (x\_1,...,x\_L) = wedge\_i in \_I y\_i, where y\_i is either x\_i or -x\_i and I subseteq [L], and can be used as classifiers. Our obfuscation approach satisfies distributional Virtual Black Box (VBB) security based on reasonable hardness assumptions, namely an entropic variant of the Ring Learning with Errors (Ring-LWE) assumption. Prior implementations of secure program obfuscation techniques support either trivial programs like point functions, or support the obfuscation of more general but less efficient branching programs to satisfy Indistinguishability Obfuscation (IO), a weaker security model. Further, the more general implemented techniques, rather than relying on standard assumptions, base their security on conjectures that have been shown to be theoretically vulnerable. Our work is the first implementation of non-trivial program obfuscation based on polynomial rings. Our contributions include multiple design and implementation advances resulting in reduced program size, obfuscation runtime, and evaluation runtime by many orders of magnitude. We implement our design in software and experimentally assess performance in a commercially available multi-core computing environment. Our implementation achieves runtimes of 6.7 hours to securely obfuscate a 64-bit conjunction program and 2.5 seconds to evaluate this program over an arbitrary input. We are also able to obfuscate a 32-bit conjunction program with 53 bits of security in 7 minutes and evaluate the obfuscated program in 43 milliseconds on a commodity desktop computer, which implies that 32-bit conjunction obfuscation is already practical. Our graph-induced (directed) encoding implementation runs up to 25 levels, which is higher than previously reported in the literature for this encoding. Our design and implementation advances are applicable to obfuscating more general compute-and-compare programs and can also be used for many cryptographic schemes based on lattice trapdoors.},

The protocol may be used to compute securely arithmetic circuits over any finite field Fpk . Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need O(n2/s) operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem. Earlier work in this model needed {$\Omega$}(n2) operations. In practice, the preprocessing prepares a secure 64-bit multiplication for 3 players in about 13 ms.},

Equivalently, it allows to accelerate matrix-vector products when the matrix is circulant. In this work, we discover that the ideas of the FFT can be applied to speed up the orthogonalization process of matrices with circulant blocks of size d x d. We show that, when d is composite, it is possible to proceed to the orthogonalization in an inductive way ---up to an appropriate re-indexation of rows and columns. This leads to a structured Gram-Schmidt decomposition. In turn, this structured Gram-Schmidt decomposition accelerates a cornerstone lattice algorithm: the nearest plane algorithm. The complexity of both algorithms may be brought down to {$\Theta$}(d log d). Our results easily extend to cyclotomic rings, and can be adapted to Gaussian samplers. This finds applications in lattice-based cryptography, improving the performances of trapdoor functions.},

In terms of the practical aspects, MatRiCT+ has 2-18x shorter proofs (depending on the number of input accounts, M) and runs 3-11x faster (for a typical transaction) in comparison to MatRiCT. A significant advantage of MatRiCT+ is that the proof length's dependence on M is very minimal (only O(log M)), while MatRiCT has a proof length linear in M. To support its efficiency, we devise several novel techniques in our design of MatRiCT+ to achieve compact lattice-based zero-knowledge proof systems, exploiting the algebraic properties of power-of-2 cyclotomic rings commonly used in practical lattice-based cryptography. Along the way, we design a family of ``optimal'' challenge spaces, using a technique we call partition-and-sample, with minimal \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-norm and invertible challenge differences (with overwhelming probability), while supporting highly-splitting power-of-2 cyclotomic rings. We believe all these results to be widely applicable and of independent interest.New results and further details are added.},

  abstract = {Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today's anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer --- which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility. In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash and uses techniques --- such as the calculation of a distributed transaction ledger --- that are currently in widespread deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this decentralized ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.},

Motivated by this, we revisit the problem of constructing blind signatures from standard lattice assumptions. We propose a new three-round lattice-based blind signature scheme whose security can be proved, in the random oracle model, from the standard SIS assumption. Our starting point is a modified version of the (insecure) BLAZE scheme, which itself is based Lyubashevsky's three-round identification scheme combined with a new aborting technique to reduce the correctness error. Our proof builds upon and extends the recent modular framework for blind signatures of Hauck, Kiltz, and Loss (EUROCRYPT '19). It also introduces several new techniques to overcome the additional challenges posed by the correctness error which is inherent to all lattice-based constructions. While our construction is mostly of theoretical interest, we believe it to be an important stepping stone for future works in this area.},

  abstract = {Digital signature is an essential primitive in cryptography, which can be used as the digital analogue of handwritten signatures but also as a building block for more complex systems. In the latter case, signatures with specific features are needed, so as to smoothly interact with the other components of the systems, such as zero-knowledge proofs. This has given rise to so-called signatures with efficient protocols, a versatile tool that has been used in countless applications. Designing such signatures is however quite difficult, in particular if one wishes to withstand quantum computing. We are indeed aware of only one post-quantum construction, proposed by Libert et al. at Asiacrypt'16, yielding very large signatures and proofs. In this paper, we propose a new construction that can be instantiated in both standard lattices and structured ones, resulting in each case in dramatic performance improvements. In particular, the size of a proof of message-signature possession, which is one of the main metrics for such schemes, can be brought down to less than 650 KB. As our construction retains all the features expected from signatures with efficient protocols, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in all systems using them, which mechanically improves their own performance, and has thus a direct impact on many applications. It can also be used to easily design new privacy-preserving mechanisms. As an example, we provide the first lattice-based anonymous credentials system.},

Although various efficient constructions have been proposed based on pre-quantum assumptions, there have been limited accomplishments in the post-quantum and especially practical settings. This research aims to derive new methods that enhance the current state of the art.  To achieve this, we make the following contributions. By distilling prior design insights, we propose a new primitive to instantiate {\textbackslash}emph\{signature with protocols\}, called commit-transferrable signature ({\textbackslash}CTS). When combined with a multi-theorem straight-line extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge ({\textbackslash}NIZKPoK), {\textbackslash}CTS gives a modular approach to construct anonymous credentials. We then show efficient instantiations of {\textbackslash}CTS and the required {\textbackslash}NIZKPoK from lattices, which are believed to be post-quantum hard. Finally, we propose concrete parameters for the {\textbackslash}CTS, {\textbackslash}NIZKPoK, and the overall Anonymous Credentials, based on Module-{\textbackslash}SIS{\textasciitilde}and Ring-{\textbackslash}LWE. This would serve as an important guidance for future deployment in practice.},

Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves bridge arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.},

We consider the problem of proving the correct evaluation of lattice-based PRFs based on the Learning-With-Rounding (\$\${\textbackslash}mathsf \{LWR\}\$\$) problem introduced by Banerjee et al. (Eurocrypt'12). Namely, we are interested zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge of triples (y,~k,~x) such that \$\$y=F\_k(x)\$\$is the correct evaluation of a PRF for a secret input x and a committed key k. While analogous statements admit efficient zero-knowledge protocols in the discrete logarithm setting, they have never been addressed in lattices so far. We provide such arguments for the key homomorphic PRF of Boneh et al. (Crypto'13) and the generic PRF implied by the \$\${\textbackslash}mathsf \{LWR\}\$\$-based pseudo-random generator. As an application of our ZK arguments, we design the first compact e-cash system based on lattice assumptions. By ``compact'', we mean that the complexity is at most logarithmic in the value of withdrawn wallets. Our system can be seen as a lattice-based analogue of the first compact e-cash construction due to Camenisch, Hohenberger and Lysyanskaya (Eurocrypt'05).},

  abstract = {Signature schemes are fundamental cryptographic primitives, useful as a stand-alone application, and as a building block in the design of secure protocols and other cryptographic objects. In this thesis, we study both the uses that signature schemes find in protocols, and the design of signature schemes suitable for a broad range of applications. An important application of digital signature schemes is an anonymous credential system. In such a system, one can obtain and prove possession of credentials without revealing any additional information. Such systems are the best means of balancing the need of individuals for privacy with the need of large organizations to verify that the people they interact with have the required credentials. We show how to construct an efficient anonymous credential system using an appropriate signature scheme; we then give an example of such asignature scheme. The resulting system is the first one with satisfactory communication and computation costs. The signature scheme we use to construct an anonymous credential system is of independent interest for use in other protocols. The special property of this signature scheme is that it admits an efficient protocol for a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of a signature. Further, we consider the question of revocation of signatures. We obtain an efficient revocation scheme.},

When instantiated with ideal lattices, the time complexity of the signing and verification algorithms, as well as key and signature size is almost linear (up to poly-logarithmic factors) in the dimension n of the underlying lattice. Since no sub-exponential (in n) time algorithm is known to solve lattice problems in the worst case, even when restricted to ideal lattices, our construction gives a digital signature scheme with an essentially optimal performance/security trade-off.A version of this work appeared at TCC 2008.

Earlier efficient 3-round schemes (Asiacrypt 2010, Financial Cryptography 2020) were recently shown to have mistakes in their proofs, and fixing them turned out to be extremely inefficient and limited the number of signatures that a signer could send to less than a dozen (Crypto 2020). In this work we propose a round-optimal, 2-round lattice-based blind signature scheme which produces signatures of length 150KB. The running time of the signing protocol is linear in the maximum number signatures that can be given out, and this limits the number of signatures that can be signed per public key. Nevertheless, the scheme is still quite efficient when the number of signatures is limited to a few dozen thousand, and appears to currently be the most efficient lattice-based candidate.},

A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).},

  abstract = {Verifiable encryption allows one to prove properties about encrypted data and is an important building block in the design of cryptographic protocols, e.g., group signatures, key escrow, fair exchange protocols, etc. Existing lattice-based verifiable encryption schemes, and even just proofs of knowledge of the encrypted data, require parallel composition of proofs to reduce the soundness error, resulting in proof sizes that are only truly practical when amortized over a large number of ciphertexts. In this paper, we present a new construction of a verifiable encryption scheme, based on the hardness of the Ring-LWE problem in the random-oracle model, for short solutions to linear equations over polynomial rings. Our scheme is ``one-shot'', in the sense that a single instance of the proof already has negligible soundness error, yielding compact proofs even for individual ciphertexts. Whereas verifiable encryption usually guarantees that decryption can recover a witness for the original language, we relax this requirement to decrypt a witness of a related but extended language. This relaxation is sufficient for many applications and we illustrate this with example usages of our scheme in key escrow and verifiably encrypted signatures.},

  abstract = {In a set membership proof, the public information consists of a set of elements and a commitment. The prover then produces a zero-knowledge proof showing that the commitment is indeed to some element from the set. This primitive is closely related to concepts like ring signatures and ``one-out-of-many'' proofs that underlie many anonymity and privacy protocols. The main result of this work is a new succinct lattice-based set membership proof whose size is logarithmic in the size of the set. We also give a transformation of our set membership proof to a ring signature scheme. The ring signature size is also logarithmic in the size of the public key set and has sizeKB for a set ofelements, andKB for a set of size. At an approximately-bit security level, these outputs are between 1.5X and 7X smaller than the current state of the art succinct ring signatures of Beullens et al. (Asiacrypt 2020) and Esgin et al. (CCS 2019). We then show that our ring signature, combined with a few other techniques and optimizations, can be turned into a fairly efficient Monero-like confidential transaction system based on the MatRiCT framework of Esgin et al. (CCS 2019). With our new techniques, we are able to reduce the transaction proof size by factors of about 4X - 10X over the aforementioned work. For example, a transaction with two inputs and two outputs, where each input is hidden amongother accounts, requires approximatelyKB in our protocol.In submission.},

Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here.

Our methods involve a new kind of trapdoor, and include specialized algorithms for inverting LWE, randomly sampling SIS preimages, and securely delegating trapdoors. These tasks were previously the main bottleneck for a wide range of cryptographic schemes, and our techniques substantially improve upon the prior ones, both in terms of practical performance and quality of the produced outputs. Moreover, the simple structure of the new trapdoor and associated algorithms can be exposed in applications, leading to further simplifications and efficiency improvements. We exemplify the applicability of our methods with new digital signature schemes and CCA-secure encryption schemes, which have better efficiency and security than the previously known lattice-based constructions.},

  abstract = {Blind signatures, proposed by Chaum (CRYPTO'82), are interactive protocols between a signer and a user, where a user can obtain a signature without revealing the message to be signed. Recently, Hauck et al. (EUROCRYPT'20) observed that all efficient lattice-based blind signatures following the blueprint of the original blind signature by R{\"u}kert (ASIACRYPT'10) have a flawed security proof. This puts us in a situation where all known lattice-based blind signatures have at least two of the following drawbacks: heuristic security; 1 MB or more signature size; only supporting bounded polynomially many signatures, or being based on non-standard assumptions. In this work, we construct the first round-optimal (i.e., two-round) lattice-based blind signature with a signature size of roughly 100 KB that supports unbounded polynomially many signatures and is provably secure under standard assumptions. Even if we allow non-standard assumptions and more rounds, ours provide the shortest signature size while simultaneously supporting unbounded polynomially many signatures. The main idea of our work is revisiting the generic blind signature construction by Fischlin (CRYPTO'06) and optimizing the commit-then-open proof using techniques tailored to lattices. Our blind signature is also the first to have a formal security proof in the quantum random oracle model. Finally, our blind signature extends naturally to partially blind signatures, where the user and signer can include an agreed-upon public string in the message.},
