With this work, we have shown that competitive and practical solutions for quantum-resistant anonymous credential systems can be built from homomorphic encryption schemas. The solution is not only viable, but also effective in implementing common identity management attributes (e.g. $>18$, residence at), and requirements (e.g. revocation). In the last couple of years other solutions for quantum-resistant anonymous credentials have emerged and others are expected to appear based on known strategies not yet explored. Evaluating and comparing all these strategies is a future-relevant work.
